Little Scrabble® Helper, LSH for short.

* What?
LSH helps you play Scrabble® by finding the words that can be played with your rack.
For this it needs a dictionary, that is a text file with all the possible words, one per line.

* How?
  You start LSH like this:
      $ ./little-scrabble-helper.rb dictfile
  where dictfile is the dictionary. The first time LSH encounter a new dictionary it will generate a dictfile_hash file which will allow the dictionary to be loaded faster later. You can delete this file and it will be created again the next time.
  Once launched LSH then waits for you to input your rack, with the . character to represent the joker, and it will show you what words of the dictionary you can play.
  Note that LSH doesn't care how many letters you gives it.

* That's all
  Enjoy.
